bool isPalindrome(string );

// pre: a character string of any length is passed by reference to this function:
//Note the main program checks for input line length and skips any line with more than 80  characters

//post:  returns true if the data line is a palindrome


//  a palindrome is a line that reads the same in reverse as it does forward using proper characters
// a proper character is an alpha or numeric character only Punctuation and spaces are ignored.
// also assumne a line with no proper characters is not a plaindrome

//implemented with char arrays which were created from the character string that was passed by reference
